## Install

1. Install MSCLoader for My Winter Car
2. Put the dll & assets in your Mods folder

## Paint & Livery System

Press **Ctrl+P** in-game to open the paint color picker.

From the paint menu you can:
- Adjust RGB color with fine and coarse controls
- Apply paint to the body, both doors, and bootlid
- Save your paint color to a file
- Reload custom textures from the assets folder
- Restore the default bachglotz livery at any time

### Custom Textures

The default bachglotz livery is stripped on the second car so you start with a clean base. If you don't put any custom textures in the folder it will just be a plain white car that you can paint any color.

If you want the original livery back, hit "Restore Default Livery" in the paint menu.
